# &Delta;T Calculator

&Delta;T is the difference between the terrestrial time (TT) and universal time (UT1). See my [dynamical time](http://ytliu.epizy.com/eclipse/dynamical_time.html) page for a brief explanation of these terms.

This package provides a python code to implement the &Delta;T calculation according to the fitting and extrapolation formulae in [Stephenson et al (2016)](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.2016.0404) and [Morrison et al (2021)](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.2020.0776). Specifically, values of Î”T from -720 to 2019 are computed using their [spline fit cubic polynomials](http://astro.ukho.gov.uk/nao/lvm/Table-S15.2020.txt). Outside this range &Delta;T is extrapolated by integrating their long-term lod function. The uncertainty in &Delta;T is estimated based on [their tables](http://astro.ukho.gov.uk/nao/lvm/) for years between -2000 to +2500. Outside this range, the error is estimated using quadratic functions. However, they are probably not reliable.

The main code is in `DeltaT.py`, in which three functions are provided. `DeltaT(y)` is the function that computes &Delta;T (in seconds) as a function of year `y` using the fitting and extrapolation formulae. `DeltaT_error_estimate(y)` provides an error estimate of &Delta;T. `DeltaT_with_error_estimate(y)` combines the two functions and returns &Delta;T(y) with an error estimate.

The notebook `DeltaT_examples.ipynb` shows examples of using these functions.

The [cubic spline polynomials](http://astro.ukho.gov.uk/nao/lvm/Table-S15.2020.txt) were fitted to the &Delta;T data from -720 to 2019. Daily values of &Delta;T in 2019 and later can be constructed from the data in [IERS bulletins](https://www.iers.org/IERS/EN/Publications/Bulletins/bulletins.html), which  can be used to calculate the error of the extrapolation formula after 2019. This is demonstrated in the notebook and the result has been incorporated in the function `DeltaT_error_estimate()`. The csv file `DeltaT_IERS.csv` contains the &Delta;T data in 2019 and later computed from the IERS data.

A javascript version of the code is used in my [eclipse website](http://ytliu.epizy.com/eclipse/).
